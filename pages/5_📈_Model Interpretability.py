    Finally, let's try to build a deeper understanding of the model. We can get a rough estimate of how important each feature is to the overall prediction in the following manner.

    The linear regression model is made up of a series of "weights". There is exactly one weight for each variable. 

    The magnitude of the weight (whether positive or negative) is **directly correlated with how important it was in the final diagnosis**.

    The weights of the linear regression model are plotted in the bar chart below.

    We can also glean further insight from the classification of weights into positive or negative categories.
